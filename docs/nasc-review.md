# nasc.js Review

## High-level observations
- `connect` currently encapsulates transport setup, patch handling, DOM validation utilities, event wiring, and transport factories in a single scope. This makes the function monolithic and hinders reuse/testing. Breaking it into modules (transport, validation, DOM patching) would reduce cognitive load.

## Duplication & Redundancy
- Element value syncing logic appears twice: once when applying `bindUpdate` patches (`na-bind` selectors) and again when updating elements within list templates. Extracting a helper like `updateElementValue(el, value)` would reduce duplication and ensure consistent handling for inputs, textareas, selects, and text nodes.
- Template item updates set checkbox/value text content the same way as simple bindings. Sharing the helper keeps parity.
- Target-type inference for validation is duplicated between the `[na-bind]` loop and the `name` loop. A dedicated `resolveTargetType(el, fallbackType)` could centralize template/type-scope traversal.
- SSE and WebSocket transports both parse JSON patches with identical `try/catch` blocks and emit similar errors. A small helper `safeParsePatches(raw, onPatchesCb, sourceLabel)` would consolidate error handling.

## Function Size & Extraction Opportunities
- `onPatches` handles error logging, schema caching, validation, list diffing, and value updates inside one loop. Consider breaking it into specialized helpers (`handleSchemaPatch`, `handleBindUpdate`, etc.) to keep each concern focused and individually testable.
- `applyKeyedDiff` mixes template cloning, scope propagation, ordering, and binding updates. Splitting into `ensureChildElement` (for create/update) and `syncChildBindings` could improve clarity.
- `validateDeclaredBindings` is long due to repeated target-type inference; factoring the inference out would shorten it and make intent clearer.
- `createSseTransport` contains fallback logic that mutates the transport object at runtime. Isolating fallback swapping into a helper (e.g., `fallbackToWebSocket(this, inferWsUrl(), onOpenCb, onPatchesCb)`) could make control flow more explicit.

## Additional Suggestions
- Cache selectors: repeated `document.querySelector` calls for `[na-instance="${p.instance}"]` might benefit from memoization or storing container references in a Map keyed by instance ID.
- Consider guarding event listeners to avoid duplicate registration when `connect` is called multiple times.
- Wrap DOM traversal logic in try/catch sparingly; broad catches can hide actionable errors. Narrow the scope or at least log suppressed exceptions for debugging.
