# Nasc Documentation

Nasc is a "live HTML" framework that keeps your markup simple while letting the server drive state and logic. It streams DOM updates from the backend to the browser over Server-Sent Events (SSE) by default and can transparently upgrade to WebSockets for bidirectional scenarios.

## Why Nasc?

- **Minimal client footprint.** The browser loads a generic `nasc.js` client that knows how to bind data, patch the DOM, and validate schemasâ€”nothing more.
- **Server-owned state.** Each HTML container declares an `na-instance="Type:id"`; the matching server handler performs all business logic and emits diffs that become DOM patches.
- **Transport flexibility.** SSE is the default, but you can opt into WebSockets per page or URL query parameter without rewriting templates.
- **Schema-aware safety.** JSON Schemas stream from the server during mount so the client can validate bindings, highlight mistakes, and help you catch regressions early.

## Documentation Map

| Section | What you will find |
| --- | --- |
| [Quick Start]({{ '/quick-start' | relative_url }}) | Spin up the demo, wire a page to handlers, and deploy.
| [Core Concepts]({{ '/core-concepts' | relative_url }}) | Learn how instances, bindings, events, and diffs interact.
| [Template Attributes Reference]({{ '/attributes' | relative_url }}) | Detailed behavior for every `na-*` attribute.
| [Event & Transport Model]({{ '/events-and-transports' | relative_url }}) | Understand how SSE/WS streams, payloads, and fallbacks work.
| [Schemas & Validation]({{ '/schemas' | relative_url }}) | How JSON Schema powers runtime validation and tooling.
| [Server Integration]({{ '/server-integration' | relative_url }}) | Use `attachNasc`, SSR middleware, and custom stores.
| [Persistence & Stores]({{ '/persistence' | relative_url }}) | Implement the store contract or plug in SQLite adapters.
| [Debugging & Tooling]({{ '/debugging' | relative_url }}) | Tips for tracing patches, schema overlays, and manifests.
| [Examples & Recipes]({{ '/recipes' | relative_url }}) | Patterns distilled from the bundled demo app.
| [FAQ]({{ '/faq' | relative_url }}) | Answers to the most common architectural questions.

> **Tip:** If you are new to "hypermedia driven UI", spend five minutes with [Quick Start]({{ '/quick-start' | relative_url }}) and then skim [Core Concepts]({{ '/core-concepts' | relative_url }}). The remaining sections dive deeper into specific tasks inspired by the htmx documentation flow.

## Project Structure Recap

Nasc currently ships as a monorepo with a reusable client/server pair and a demo app that showcases end-to-end wiring.

```
packages/
  nasc-client/     # Browser runtime (nasc.js)
  nasc-server/     # Express-friendly reference server

demo/              # Example application with handlers, schemas, and HTML
```

Use pnpm from the repository root to install dependencies and run the demo app while you experiment with the code samples in this guide.

## Next Steps

1. Head to [Quick Start]({{ '/quick-start' | relative_url }}) to run the demo and scaffold your first page.
2. Read [Core Concepts]({{ '/core-concepts' | relative_url }}) to understand how mounts, events, and patches fit together.
3. Bookmark [Template Attributes Reference]({{ '/attributes' | relative_url }}) for day-to-day development.

Happy building!
