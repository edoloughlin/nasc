## Description

Should be able to set a limit for template rendering and control the next/previous render and fetch of data. The limit/batch side can be static or could be taken from an na-bind.
The client code should have no opinion about how the data is rendered but should make the batch size, current page and number of pages available and should facilitate creating links or buttons to navigte to the next/previous, first/last or a specific page.
